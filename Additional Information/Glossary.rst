  CAD
    Computer Aided Design (CAD) is a method of creating sketches, parts and assemblies virtually.  This is used precisely convey and simulate what a part or assembly will do and gives detail on how such a part should be made.  There are many CAD softwares, including softwares that must be installed such as Autodesk (Inventor/Fusion 360), Solidworks and CREO, as well as softwares that can be run directly in an internet browser such as Onshape.  Nearly all of these CAD softwares have free educational licences and tutorials on their respective websites. 
    
  CAM
    Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) is a software that generates :term:`gcode` from a :term:`CAD` designed part, and the user's instructions.  These CAM softwares vastly improve the process of using :term:`CNC` machines are increasingly being built into CAD softwares.

  CNC
    Computer Numerical Control (CNC) is a method of using a computer to control a machine's movenments precisely based on instructions interpreted from :term:`gcode`.  Most commonly this refers to CNC machining processes such as CNC mills, but there are many other applications of CNC, such as turning (CNC lathes), bending (CNC brakes), welding and even additive manufacturing (3D printing).

  Endmill
    An endmill is a cutting tool that is designed to cut both axially and radially.  These are typically used in CNC applications.

  Flute
    A flute is a cutting edge or channel in an :term:`Endmill`.  The number of theses flutes changes the rate at which material is being removed from the stock at a given feed rate as well as the size of each bit of material that is removed.  A higher number of flutes generally produces a better "shinier" surface finish due to the finer amount of material reduced, however, this also reduces the strength of the endmill due to the flutes reducing the size of the core (solid portion in the center of the endmill).

  gcode
    gcode is the language of :term:`CNC` machines and are the instructions that it follows.  gcode can be written by hand, but is most often generated by other computer software.  However--see the reference on :doc:`gcode Reference`, for some common commands that are useful for debugging and understanding what a program or :term:`Path` is trying to accomplish.

  Nesting
    Nesting is the process of aligning parts in a space efficient manner.  Some softwares can do this, but manual layot is most common for small scale applications such as in FRC.

  Origin
    The origin is designated as X=0, Y=0, Z=0.  The machine being used has a physical origin (Machine Origin) and then zeros that are set by the user (Working Origins) for their part.  These Working Origins are designated in the :term:`gcode` as commands such as ``G54``, ``G55`` and higher commands which tell the machine which orign set to utilize in a CNC operation.  **Note:** While ``G54`` is the standard. it can be helpful to use other more uncomon origins for different setups that you will return to, or for multiple users on the same machine (where the origin stays the same).  To change the Working Origin see :doc:`/CAM Preparation/Multiple Origins/Multiple Origins`.      

  Path
    In :term:`CNC` manufacturing, a path refers to a section of :term:`gcode`, or a subset of a program that a CNC can follow.  

  Router
    In :term:`CNC` milling, a router differs from that of a full CNC mill in that its spindle spins much faster and typically less precise control over the RPM and do not have coolant.  As such, 1 :term:`flute` :term:`Endmill`s are often used to reduce the heat produced.  Routers are designed to primarily cut softer materials such as wood or plastic, but can sometimes cut soft metals such as aluminum.  Larger CNC machines typically can work with much harder materials, but usually do not use wood due to the coolant used.  These spindles are much stronger and have greater control of their generally lower RPM range.  Due to this, endmills with different numbers of :term:`flutes` can be used depending on the application.  

  Stock
    Stock is refering to the base material that is being machined away in :term:`Subtractive Manufacturing`.

  Subtractive Manufacturing
    Subtractive Manufacturing is a manufacturing process that removes material.  This is the opposite of Additive Manufacturing (Ex: 3D printing), which builds up a part by adding material.

  Spindle
    On a :term:`CNC`, the spindle is the portion of the mill that spins the tool to cut the material.

  Work Holding
    Work Hoding is the fixturing and process by which stock (material that has not yet gone through the operation) is held in place while it is being machined.
