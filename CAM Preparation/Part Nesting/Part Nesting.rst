Part Nesting
============================

To begin parts must be created or imported from a :term:`CAD` software and imported into Fusion 360.  If you are using a native Fusion 360 part, skip to :ref:`Nesting`, otherwise continue to :ref:`importing files into fusion 360`. 


Importing Files into Fusion 360
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For importing a file from a Autodesk software, native parts should be easily opened by Fusion 360.  If a part is created in any other software, the ``.STP`` or ``.STEP`` file format is recommended.

Nesting
++++++++++++++

The process of :term:`Nesting` in FRC is typically done manually, due to the small scale production of parts and varied methods of :term:`Work Holding`.  Howver, nesting can be a very useful process to limit tool changes and workholding setups and save material.

When nesting your parts for batch production, keep in mind the following considerations:

* Ensure there is sufficient gap between your parts for the endmill fit between your parts.  For better finish, ensure this distance is minimally the endmill diameter + 2x the finishing pass depth.
* Consider how each finished part and bit of excess material will be held in place as they are being cut.
* Try to co
