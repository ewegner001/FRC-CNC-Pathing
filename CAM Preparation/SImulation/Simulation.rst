Simulation
========================

Before running these :term:`paths <Path>` on an actual :term:`CNC` machine, it is prudent to first simulate the paths virtually to ensure that the paths are doing what you expect.  CNC machines do what they are told to -- so you better make sure your instructions are right!  This can potentially identify collisions, unintended interferences and may show that the paths you made aren't able to complete all operations (Ex: the tool is too large to make a desired internal radius).  This also gives you a good perspective on what to expect operating a path.  Even if you've made the path and parts like this many, many times before using the template, always take the quick minute it takes to simulate the operation--this will save you a lot of headaches later on.
