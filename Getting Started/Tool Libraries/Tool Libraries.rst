* **Document Specific**: These libraries are temporary and consist of all the tools used within that particular document.  These can be copies from any other library or custom to that document, however any modifications or new tools created remain only with that document.
* **Local**: Local Libraries are libraries that you create or import.
* **Fusion 360 Libraries**: Fusion 360 Libraries are example tools that can accelerate getting settings that work for a particular tool and material.
