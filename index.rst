Welcome to FRC CNC Pathing documentation!
===========================================
This documentation will walk you through the process of making a part using CNC manufacturing, utilizing processes developed by `FIRST Robotics Competition <https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc>`_ Teams `930 <https://www.team930.com/>`_ and `1714 <https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/1714>`_.  This documentation will focus on the steps and configurations required to produce common parts on OMIO or Haas based machines, but the core concepts should be applicible to any other CNC manufacturing process.

To begin check out the :doc:`Getting Started/About/About` section for further information on CNC manufacturing, or :doc:`/Getting Started/Prerequisites/Prerequisites` to begin.
